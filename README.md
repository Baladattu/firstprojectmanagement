# firstprojectmanagement

A collaborative project for project management with milestones.
## Significance of Initial Project Setup & Documentation
This milestone is critical because it lays the foundation for the entire project. By setting up the repository and creating clear documentation, all collaborators will have a solid understanding of the projectâ€™s goals, workflow, and contributions. This ensures everyone is aligned before the actual development begins and helps avoid confusion down the line. The tasks within this milestone (like creating a README, assigning team roles, and setting up basic project files) will act as a blueprint for the next phases.

## Plan for Tracking Project Progress:
* Monitor Status: The board will help track the overall project health by showing what is in progress and what has been completed.
* Prioritize Tasks: Issues in the To Do column can be prioritized and assigned to team members based on deadlines or importance.
* Review Work: Once tasks are moved to Done, the team can review them to ensure they meet the requirements before closing the issues.
* Collaborate Effectively: Team members will know which tasks are pending, who is working on what, and what has been completed without needing constant communication.
